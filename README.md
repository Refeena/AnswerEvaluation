The manual system for evaluation of Subjective Answers for technical subjects involves a lot of time and effort of the evaluator.
Subjective answers have various parameters upon which they can
be evaluated such as the question specific content and writing style.
Evaluating subjective answers is a critical task to Perform. When
human being evaluates anything, the quality of evaluation may
vary along with the emotions of the person. Performing evaluation
through computers using intelligent techniques ensures uniformity
in marking as the same inference mechanism is used for all the students. In Machine Learning, all result is only based on the input
data provided by the user. Our Proposed System uses machine
learning and NLP to solve this problem
